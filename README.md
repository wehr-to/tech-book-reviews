# Technical Book Reviews

## Why this repo exists:
- This is a dedicated repository to track and log every technical book I read and reviewing it; based on the criteria of what I learned, what I already knew that was enhanced, why I decided to read the book in the first place, and projects/certification studies tied into said book
- Includes a list of future reads to outline my goals
- To provide insights for those looking to find a new read
